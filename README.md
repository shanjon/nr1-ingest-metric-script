# nr1-ingest-metric-script  <br>
create custom metric via synthetic script to capture New Relic One ingest


## tl;dr
Use this script to set up a synthetic monitor that:
  1. Queries ingestion by data source, faceted by the attribute of your choice (e.g., `APM Events` by `appName`)
  2. Transforms the output into a metric that is pushed to the Metric API
  3. Can be queried for consumption analysis / dashboards for 13 months


## objective
Consumption-based pricing has motivated New Relic users to analyze data ingest more closely and identify opportunities to optimize; i.e., help me understand:
> What are we sending?<br>
> Is it valuable?<br>
> Are we sending more this month than we did last month?

Due to the 8-day default retention for event data, our users’ ability to understand ingest over periods longer than that is limited. For customers sending large volumes of a particular event, even querying the last 8 days may not be possible.

This script can be configured as a synthetic monitor to periodically query ingest and post it as a custom metric for longer storage, and thus, long-term querying and analysis.

Originally developed for MercadoLibre, a live instance of this script is querying and pushing `newrelic.ingest` metrics to `Demotron V2`. You can query this data by setting `metricName`=`'newrelic.ingest'`.

## getting started
  1. _Required_ - Update the `QUERYKEY`, `INSERTAPIKEY`, and `ACCOUNTID` variables
  2. _Optional_ - Update the `HOURS` variable to set the time interval for the query (i.e., do you want to capture data ingestion for the past 1, 24, 168 hours?) - by default, this is set to 1
  3. _Optional_ - Update the faceted attribute used for each query (i.e., `FACET_METRICS`, `FACET_BROWSER`, `FACET_TRACING`, etc.). - by default, the value for `APM Events`, `Metrics`, `Browser Events`, `Tracing`, and `Mobile Events` is `appName`, for `Infrastructure Processes` and `Infrastructure Hosts` is `hostname`, for `Logging` is `labels.app`, for `Pixie` is `k8s.cluster.name`, and for `Networking Monitoring` is `instrumentation.name`
  5. _Optional_ - Update the `name` parameter within the metric payload - by default, this is set to `newrelic.ingest`

**Note**: You do not need to remove the queries for data types not present in the account - if the query returns an empty array, it will skip to the next query without printing the prior empty result.


## installation
Once you have updated the script according to your needs, create the monitor as follows:
  1. Select Endpoint availability (Scripted API)
  2. Name your monitor and configure the Period
  4. Select a location (any)
  5. Validate the script and confirm no errors
  6. Save the monitor
  7. Run test check and view data by querying
      ``FROM Metric SELECT * WHERE metricName='newrelic.ingest'``
  Filter on data types by using the `ingestType` attribute

**Note**: The Period you configure when setting up the script should match the value you set in the script’s `HOURS` variable - i.e., if the script is set to query ingest for the past hour (i.e., `HOURS` = 1), the script should run every hour so that the results also correspond to ingestion for the past hour.

## including custom events
You can also update the script to include any custom event(s) in your data ingestion metric. Within the `STATEMENTS` multi-dimensional array, add an additional array that includes 2 elements (delimited by commas):
  1. A query that returns data ingestion estimate for each custom event
  2. A label for the `ingestType`

For example:
``"SELECT bytecountestimate()/10e8 FROM “Purchase” SINCE “ + HOURS + “ hours ago LIMIT MAX”, “Custom Events”``

_Optional_ - If you want to facet on the custom event(s) as well, add this as the last element in the array and  define within the list of `VARIABLES` that third variable for the custom event’s faceted attribute (e.g., var `FACET_CUSTOMEVENTS` = `'payment.processor’`).

For example:<br>
``"SELECT bytecountestimate()/10e8 FROM “Purchase” SINCE “ + HOURS + “ hours ago LIMIT MAX”, “Custom Events”, FACET_CUSTOMEVENTS``


## dashboard
A dashboard for the custom metric is available in `dashboard.json`
